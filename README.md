Hello Hello.

The ofiicial first page done in html by me... hehe.
This is not actually my frist work in html though as I guess I have not been too serious with it,
I am officially serious with full stack development and I have set my mind to being a developer, hence, my official first html page.

This is a google homepage which will be deconstructed and reconstructed.
